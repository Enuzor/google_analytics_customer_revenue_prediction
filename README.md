## Introduction
Welcome, this repository is used to track code related to one of my theses for my Bsc Hons in Mathematical Sciences (UCC Class 2019). This project relates to predicting the revenue generated by customers based on their interactions with the web store. In this case the data is extracted from the google merchandise store. More details can be found below. 

## Abstract
The leveraging of customer data to provide actionable commercial insights is a well-established practice in modern data analysis. Thanks to technological advances over the past few years the implementation of machine learning algorithms on large sets of data has become more feasible. This combined with the accessibility of large and scalable computing resources has enabled businesses to analyse large datasets which they previously might not have been capable of.
In light of these points this report will analyse customer data generated by an online merchandise store (Google Merchandise Store), with the goal of predicting how much a particular customer will spend within some future time interval. This repo contains code for data handling, analysis and model selection procedures employed to generate such predictions. Furthermore, a discussion on the technologies used to perform such analysis is included in the report as part of this repo.

## Where to find the data

The data for this project was taken from the popular data science website known as Kaggle. Users who sign up for an account and accept the necessary terms and conditions can download the data here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/data.



## Accessing the Report & Code
The report can be accessed from the reports folder within the following repository in the form of a pdf document. 
The code files for this project are split between data preprocessing and model fitting. You will find both in the
source code folder labelled src.
